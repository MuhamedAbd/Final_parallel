 Multi-threaded Sorting Algorithms GUI

This Java application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for sorting integers from a file using different sorting algorithms in both sequential and parallel modes. The project demonstrates the power of parallel programming.

Features

 Upload a file containing a list of comma-separated integers.
  Choose from multiple sorting algorithms:
    - Merge Sort
    - Quick Sort
    - Bubble Sort
Select execution mode:
  - Sequential
  - Parallel (multi-threaded)
 Display sorting time and sorted results directly in the GUI.

 How It Works

1. Upload a file containing comma-separated integers.
2. Choose your sorting algorithm and execution mode.
4. Click Sort and view the result along with execution time.

Technologies Used

- Java
- Java Swing for GUI
- Multi-threading for parallel algorithms

Educational Use
This project is ideal for demonstrating:
- The differences between sequential and parallel execution
- The effect of thread count on performance
- Real-world application of divide-and-conquer and parallel design patterns
